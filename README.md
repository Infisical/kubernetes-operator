## Introduction

**[Infisical](https://infisical.com)** is the open source secret management platform that teams use to centralize their secrets like API keys, database credentials, and configurations.

The Infisical Operator is a collection of Kubernetes controllers that streamline how secrets are managed between Infisical and your Kubernetes cluster. It provides multiple Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) which enable you to:

- Sync secrets from Infisical into Kubernetes (`InfisicalSecret`).
- Push new secrets from Kubernetes to Infisical (`InfisicalPushSecret`).
- Manage dynamic secrets and automatically create time-bound leases (`InfisicalDynamicSecret`).

## Security

Please do not file GitHub issues or post on our public forum for security vulnerabilities, as they are public!

Infisical takes security issues very seriously. If you have any concerns about Infisical or believe you have uncovered a vulnerability, please get in touch via the e-mail address security@infisical.com. In the message, try to provide a description of the issue and ideally a way of reproducing it. The security team will get back to you as soon as possible.

Note that this security address should be used only for undisclosed vulnerabilities. Please report any security problems to us before disclosing it publicly.

## Getting Started
You’ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/k8-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/k8-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

Also, after editing the API definitions, update the kubectl-install folder:

```sh
make kubectl-install
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
